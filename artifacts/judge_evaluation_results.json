        "response": "The increasing adoption of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in various aspects of life has led to a growing need for Explainable AI (XAI), which aims to provide transparent and understandable explanations of AI-driven decisions (Liao & Varshney, 2021). As XAI continues to evolve, it is essential to understand the key principles and design approaches that cater to the needs of novice users. This literature review synthesizes the findings of recent studies on XAI, highlighting the importance of human-centered approaches, explainability principles, and multidisciplinary collaboration.\n\nOne of the primary themes that emerges from the literature is the emphasis on human-centered design approaches for XAI. Liao and Varshney (2021) stress the importance of considering the user's perspective and experience in XAI, highlighting the need for a brief overview of the technical landscape of XAI to inform user experiences. Similarly, Wang et al. (2019) advocate for user-centric design approaches, focusing on the needs and experiences of the end-users. These studies demonstrate a shift towards user-centric design, recognizing that XAI systems must be designed with the user in mind (Liao et al., 2020; Zhu et al., 2018).\n\nAnother crucial aspect of XAI is the development of explainability principles. Phillips et al. (2021) propose four principles of explainable artificial intelligence, including delivering understandable explanations and providing user control over the system. Mohseni et al. (2021) also present a framework for designing and evaluating XAI systems, incorporating user control and accountability principles. These studies highlight the need for standardized guidelines and frameworks for XAI, emphasizing the importance of explainability and transparency (Liao & Varshney, 2021).\n\nThe literature also reveals a growing recognition of the importance of considering user backgrounds and impressions in XAI. Nourani et al. (2022) discuss the importance of user backgrounds and impressions, highlighting the need for XAI systems to be adaptable to different user groups. Similarly, Mohseni et al. (2021) emphasize the importance of considering user backgrounds and impressions in the design of XAI systems. These studies demonstrate that XAI systems must be designed to accommodate diverse user groups and contexts (Liao et al., 2020).\n\nIn terms of design methodologies, the literature presents various approaches, including user-centric design (Wang et al., 2019), heuristic-based design (Liao et al., 2020), and mixed-initiative co-creation (Zhu et al., 2018). These approaches have their strengths and limitations, and the choice of design methodology depends on the specific context and user group. For example, heuristic-based design may be more suitable for certain user groups or applications, while principle-based approaches may provide a more structured framework for designing XAI systems (Phillips et al., 2021; Mohseni et al., 2021).\n\nThe literature also highlights the importance of multidisciplinary collaboration in XAI. Mohseni et al. (2021) present a multidisciplinary survey and framework for design and evaluation of XAI systems, incorporating insights from human-computer interaction, artificial intelligence, and design. Similarly, Dhanorkar et al. (2021) emphasize the need for broadening the XAI design space by looking at explanations across the AI lifecycle. These studies demonstrate that XAI requires collaboration across disciplines, presenting opportunities for researchers from diverse backgrounds to contribute to the field (Liao & Varshney, 2021).\n\nDespite the progress made in XAI, there are still research gaps and opportunities. Liao and Varshney (2021) highlight the importance of conducting user studies to better understand user needs and experiences in XAI. Nourani et al. (2022) also suggest that more research is needed to understand the impact of user backgrounds and impressions on XAI systems. Additionally, there is a need for more research on standardization and guidelines for XAI, as well as the development of more effective design methodologies (Phillips et al., 2021; Mohseni et al., 2021).\n\nIn conclusion, this literature review highlights the key principles and design approaches for XAI, emphasizing the importance of human-centered design, explainability principles, and multidisciplinary collaboration. The studies reviewed demonstrate a growing recognition of the need for XAI systems that cater to the needs of novice users, and highlight the importance of considering user backgrounds and impressions. While there are still research gaps and opportunities, the field of XAI is evolving rapidly, with a increasing emphasis on multidisciplinary collaboration and standardization. Future research should focus on addressing these gaps, developing more effective design methodologies, and establishing standardized guidelines and frameworks for XAI (Liao & Varshney, 2021; Mohseni et al., 2021).\n\nReferences:\nDhanorkar, S., Wolf, C.

The papers cited, such as Liao and Varshney (2021), Phillips et al. (2021), and Mohseni et al. (2021), are highly relevant to the topic and provide a solid foundation for the review.\n\nThe review also includes different perspectives, such as the importance of user backgrounds and impressions (Nourani et al., 2022), and the need for standardized guidelines and frameworks for XAI (Phillips et al., 2021; Mohseni et al., 2021). The inclusion of various design methodologies, such as user-centric design (Wang et al., 2019) and heuristic-based design (Liao et al., 2020), adds to the comprehensiveness of the review.\n\nHowever, the review could be improved by including more recent studies or works that provide a more in-depth analysis of the topic. Additionally, some major works in the field of XAI, such as those related to model interpretability and transparency, are not explicitly mentioned. The review could also benefit from a more critical evaluation of the papers cited, rather than simply presenting their findings.\n\nOverall, the review provides a good overview of the key principles and design approaches for XAI, but could be strengthened by a more comprehensive coverage of relevant papers and a more in-depth analysis of the topic. The score of 8 reflects the review's strengths in terms of relevance and scope, but also acknowledges the potential for improvement in terms of comprehensiveness and critical evaluation.",
                "evidence_quality": "The literature review demonstrates a good quality and authority of sources, with proper citation formatting. The sources cited are from reputable venues and journals, such as ACM and arXiv, which indicates a high level of authority in the field of Explainable AI. The inclusion of highly-cited papers, such as Liao and Varshney (2021) and Mohseni et al.

                "clarity_organization": "The literature review is well-structured and organized, with a clear introduction that sets the context for the topic of Explainable AI (XAI) and its importance for novice users. The review is divided into logical sections, each focusing on a specific aspect of XAI, such as human-centered design approaches, explainability principles, and multidisciplinary collaboration. The transitions between sections are generally smooth, with each section building on the previous one to create a cohesive narrative.\n\nThe writing is clear and easy to follow, with technical terms and concepts explained in a way that is accessible to a non-expert audience. The use of transitional phrases and sentences helps to connect the different ideas and sections, creating a logical flow of ideas. The review also does a good job of summarizing the key findings of the source papers and synthesizing them into a coherent overview of the current state of XAI research.\n\nOne area for improvement is that the review could benefit from more explicit connections between the different sections and ideas. At times, the transitions between sections feel a bit abrupt, and it is not always clear how the different ideas and concepts fit together. Additionally, some of the sentences are quite long and convoluted, which can make them difficult to follow. Finally, the review could benefit from a more detailed conclusion that summarizes the main findings and implications of the review, and provides a clearer direction for future research.\n\nOverall, however, the review is well-organized and clearly written, making it easy to follow and understand the key principles and design approaches for XAI. With some minor revisions to address the areas mentioned above, the review could be even stronger and more effective at communicating its message to the reader."
